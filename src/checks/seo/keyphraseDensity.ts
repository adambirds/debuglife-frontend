/**
 * This function calculates keyphrase density in a more advanced manner:
 * - It uses the existing getSentences helper (which leverages compromise)
 *   to split the text into sentences.
 * - It splits the keyphrase into individual words.
 * - For each sentence, it checks if every word in the keyphrase is present.
 * - Each sentence that contains all keyphrase words is counted as one occurrence.
 * - Density is computed as: (number of matching sentences / total word count) * 100.
 *
 * Thresholds:
 *  - Green if density is between 0.5% and 3%.
 *  - Amber if density is borderline (0.3â€“0.5% or 3â€“3.5%).
 *  - Red otherwise.
